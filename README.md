Service Request & Incident Handling System

This is a simple JavaScript-based project that simulates
basic service request and incident handling.

The project validates user input, manages request status,
and handles data using JSON format.

This project was developed as a basic academic exercise
to understand JavaScript logic and workflow concepts.
